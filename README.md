## How to Install Software:
    - The libraries numpy, pandas, and matplotlib are necessary for this
      project to run correctly. To install them, run the following in the
      command line:
          - `conda install numpy`
          - `conda install pandas`
          - `conda install matplotlib`
    - To run the functional tests using the Stupid Simple baSh Framework,
      you will also need to install the network utility `wget`. `wget` can
      be downloaded from http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/wget.htm
      and will need to be installed with `conda install wget` prior to 
      running the functional tests.
